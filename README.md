MacroAPI
========

MacroAPI is a library containing frequently used methods for computer macros. Rather than continuously reinventing the wheel, all of these useful methods are packaged in one convenient place that can be referenced from my other applications. The beauty of having a library such as this one is that other people can also benefit from my methods and perhaps even improve them.
