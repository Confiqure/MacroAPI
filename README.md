MacroAPI
========

MacroAPI is a library that contains most of my frequently used methods involving macros. Rather than continuously reinventing the wheel, all of my common methods can be placed in one convenient place and referenced from in my other applications. The beauty of having a library such as this one is that other people can benefit from my methods and perhaps even improve them.
